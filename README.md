Web Scraping and Mongo Homework

In this homework assignment, we were tasked with scraping data and images from five different websites, creating a MongoDB database to hold the scraped data, and to build an app that would call the scraper we built and then create a template for website upon which to display the scraped data.

In this repository, you will find an .ipynb file that shows the output of the scraper function, the app.py and scrape_mars.py file it calls, the rendered index.html template and the style sheet (stored in the folder named static) that index.html draws it's CSS styles from, and screen shots of the rendered template displaying the scraped data as a webpage.
